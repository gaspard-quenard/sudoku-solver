# sudoku-solver
My implementation of a sudoku solver in C++ with SDL.

You can see on each square the current possibility for the numbers.

To initialize the array, click on the square where you want to add a number and enter it on the console.

When the array is initialized, click on the space bar. Then, click on the letter 't' if you want to fill entirely the sudoku, or click on the space bar if you want to fill only one number.
